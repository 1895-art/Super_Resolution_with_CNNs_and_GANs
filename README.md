We investigated the problem of image super-resolution (SR), where we want to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution images. We presented a residual learning framework to ease the training of the substantially deep network. Specifically, we reformulated the structure of the deep-recursive neural network to improve its performance. To further improve image qualities, we built a super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) framework, where we proposed several loss functions based on perceptual loss, i.e. SSIM loss and/ or total variation (TV) loss, to enhance the structural integrity of generative images. Moreover, a condition is injected to resolve the problem of losing partial information associated with GANs. 

The results show that our methods and trails can achieve equivalent performance on most of the benchmarks compared with the previous state-of-art methods, and out-perform them in terms of the structural similarity. Here are a few example outputs:

We provide:
- Code to „Äêbuild datasets](#build-datasets)
- Code to [run the model on new images](#running-on-new-images), on GPU
- [Evaluation code](#evaluation) for super resolution
- Instructions for [training the model](#training)

## Installation
This project was implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/#pip-install-pytorch) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## build datasets
```bash
python build_dataset.py --data_dir data/SIGNS --output_dir data/64x64_SIGNS
```

## To use our code:
Pytorch implementation of CNN and GAN based super-resolution models.

You need to download CelebA data to the root directory and build the dataset if you want to train from the beginning.

To train the model, you need to run the train.py in either directory cnn or directory gan. 

python train.py --data_dir <../YOUR_TRAIN_IMAGE_DIRECTORY> --model_dir experiments/<YOUR_MODEL_NAME> --model <YOUR_MODEL_NAME> --cuda <YOUR_CUDA> --optim <YOUR_OPTIMIZER> (--restore_file 'best' "IF YOU WANT TO TRAIN WITH WEIGHTS")

For example, if you want to train with data in your /data/train directory with the model "drrn_b1u9_model" with cuda0 and adam optimizer,

python train.py --data_dir ../data/train --model_dir experiments/drrn_b1u9_model --model drrn_b1u9 --cuda cuda0 --optim adam


To test our trained model,
python evaluate.py --data_dir <../YOUR_TEST_IMAGE_DIRECTORY> --model_dir experiments/<YOUR_MODEL_NAME> --model <YOUR_MODEL_NAME> --cuda <YOUR_CUDA> 


python evaluate.py --data_dir ../data/test --model_dir experiments/drrn_b1u9_model --model drrn_b1u9 --cuda cuda0
